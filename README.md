# Web Scraper Project

This project is a web scraper built using Python. It fetches data from a specified website, extracts relevant information, and stores it in a CSV file for further analysis. The scraper can handle multiple pages and includes features for robust data extraction and storage.

## Features

- **HTTP Requests**: Uses the `requests` library to fetch web pages.
- **HTML Parsing**: Utilizes `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML content.
- **Data Storage**: Stores extracted data in a `pandas` DataFrame and saves it as a CSV file.
- **Multiple Pages**: Capable of scraping data from multiple pages.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for network requests and HTML parsing.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `lxml`
```
You can install the required libraries using `pip`:
```sh
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas lxml
```
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraper.git
cd web-scraper
```

2. **Modify the URL and Parameters**

Edit the `scraper.py` file to set the base URL and any specific parameters for your scraping needs.

3. **Run the Scraper**

```sh
python scraper.py
```

4. **View the Results**

The scraped data will be stored in a file named `all_products.csv` in the project directory.
Example CodeHere is a simplified example of how the scraper works:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

base_url = 'https://example.com/products?page='
all_data = []

for page in range(1, 6):  # Adjust the range according to the number of pages
    url = base_url + str(page)
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'lxml')
    products = soup.find_all('div', class_='product')
    
    for product in products:
        name = product.find('h2', class_='product-name').text
        price = product.find('span', class_='product-price').text
        description = product.find('p', class_='product-description').text
        all_data.append({'Name': name, 'Price': price, 'Description': description})

df = pd.DataFrame(all_data)
df.to_csv('all_products.csv', index=False)
```
Advanced Features
Respect Robots.txt: Ensure you are allowed to scrape the website by checking its robots.txt file.

Rate Limiting: Use time.sleep to introduce delays between requests to avoid overloading the server.

Error Handling: Implement error handling to manage network and parsing errors gracefully.
